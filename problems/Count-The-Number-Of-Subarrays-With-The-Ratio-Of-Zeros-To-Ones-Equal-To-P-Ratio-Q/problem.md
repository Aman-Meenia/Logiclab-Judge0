# Count The Number Of Subarrays With The Ratio Of Zeros To Ones Equal To P/Q

&nbsp;

#### You are given an array arr[] of size n consisting of only 0s and 1s. Your task is to find the number of subarrays where the ratio of the number of 0s to the number of 1s is equal to p/q, where p and q are given integers.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Input**

```
arr = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
```

&nbsp;

```
p = 2
```

&nbsp;

```
q = 2
```

&nbsp;

**Output**

```
8
```

&nbsp;

**Example 2:**

&nbsp;

**Input**

```
arr = [1, 0, 1, 0]
```

&nbsp;

```
p = 1
```

&nbsp;

```
q = 1
```

&nbsp;

**Output**

```
4
```

&nbsp;

### Constraints

&nbsp;

- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

  &nbsp;

- arr[i]= 0 or 1
